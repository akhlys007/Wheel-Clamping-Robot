## Overview
The design focuses on a robot that employs computer vision to identify illegally parked cars or any parking infractions such as double parking, parking in a restricted zone without permission and parking in a way that causes congestion. Upon identification of any parking misdeed, the robot automatically clamps the motor vehicle and notifies a tow truck about collection at a stipulated time.

## Mechanical components
### Platform and chassis

To build the base of the robot we decided to use Steel for its properties of wear resistance and resistance to harsh weather conditions. The Steel also ensures that the robot will be able to handle heavier weights.

### Wheels

As the robot moves on asphalt, the tire material decided on was rubber for improved grip. The rubber component also presents a lower rolling resistance. 
The wheels have been made of aluminum alloy due to its corrosion resistance. Aluminum is also lighter than steel and hence ensures a smoother ride. Since they are stronger than steel, the have an added advantage of increased damage resistance.
### Clamp

After considering most of the clamps present in the market, it was agreed upon that the robot needed its own newly designed clamp that would work easily in tandem with it. 
Our design incorporates retractable links to provide a considerable grip on the wheel. 
The material used is steel.
## Navigation Method

The 2 front wheels are driven by motors relying on the differential method of steering. This is where the two front wheels share a common axis of rotation and the velocity of each wheel is varied for maximum maneuveribility. This steering system also ensures that there isnâ€™t a need for any additional steering mechanism. 
### How Distance Is Calculated 
Through the use of reflectance sensors that measure the number of wheel revolutions.
